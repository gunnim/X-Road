Feature: 0500 - Signer

  Scenario: Initialization
    Given tokens list contains token "0"
    And token "0" status is "NOT_INITIALIZED"
    When signer is initialized with pin "1234"
    Then token "0" is not active
    And token "0" status is "OK"

  Scenario: Activate token
    Given token "0" is not active
    When token "0" is logged in with pin "1234"
    Then token "0" is active

  Scenario: Deactivate token
    When token "0" is logged out
    Then token "0" is not active

  Scenario: Update token pin
    Given token "0" is not active
    And token "0" is logged in with pin "1234"
    When token "0" pin is updated from "1234" to "4321"
    And token "0" is logged in with pin "4321"
    Then token "0" is active

  Scenario: Set token friendly name
    When name "New friendly name" is set for token "0"
    Then token "0" name is "New friendly name"

  Scenario: Key generation
    When new key "key-1" generated for token "0"
    And name "First key" is set for generated key
    When new key "key-2" generated for token "0"
    And name "Second key" is set for generated key
    When new key "key-3" generated for token "0"
    And name "Third key" is set for generated key
    Then token "0" has exact keys "First key,Second key,Third key"
    And sign mechanism for token "0" key "Second key" is not null

  Scenario: Delete key
    Given new key "key-X" generated for token "0"
    And name "KeyX" is set for generated key
    Then token info can be retrieved by key id
    When key "Third key" is deleted from token "0"
    Then token "0" has exact keys "First key,Second key,KeyX"

  Scenario: Sign
    Given digest can be signed using key "KeyX" from token "0"

  Scenario: Generate/Regenerate cert request
    When cert request is generated for token "0" key "Second key" for client "cs:test:member-2"
    And token and key can be retrieved by cert request
    Then cert request can be deleted
    When cert request is generated for token "0" key "Second key" for client "cs:test:member-2"
    And cert request is regenerated

  Scenario: Self signed certificate
    Given token "0" key "First key" has 0 certificates
    When self signed cert generated for token "0" key "First key", client "cs:test:member-1"
    Then token "0" key "First key" has 1 certificates
    And keyId can be retrieved by cert hash
    And token and keyId can be retrieved by cert hash
    And certificate can be signed using key "First key" from token "0"

  Scenario: Member info
    Then member "cs:test:member-1" has 1 certificate

  Scenario: Cert status
    Given self signed cert generated for token "0" key "KeyX", client "cs:test:member-2"
    And certificate info can be retrieved by cert hash
    Then certificate can be deactivated
    And certificate can be activated
    And certificate status can be changed to "deletion in progress"
    And certificate can be deleted

  Scenario: Miscellaneous checks
    * check token "0" key "First key" batch signing enabled
